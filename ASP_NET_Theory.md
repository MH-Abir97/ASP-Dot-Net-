# Dependency Injection

### What is Dependency Injection in C# ?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to make objects loosely coupled more  testable, and easier to maintain.In this pattern, objects are not responsible for creating their own dependencies but instead, the dependencies are injected from outside. This is achieved by creating an interface that defines the dependencies and their methods and then implementing that interface in the dependent object.

To implement Dependency Injection in C#, you need to follow these steps:

1.Identify the dependencies of your object.
2.Create an interface that defines the methods for those dependencies.
3.Implement that interface in the dependent object.
4.Use a Dependency Injection framework to inject the dependencies into the dependent object.

In C#, there are several Dependency Injection frameworks available that help to implement this pattern, such as:

1.Ninject
2.Autofac
3.Unity
4.Simple Injector
5.Castle Windsor


Yes, there are several Dependency Injection frameworks available for various programming languages. Some of the popular Dependency Injection frameworks for C# are:

1. Ninject: It is an open-source Dependency Injection framework that helps to inject dependencies into objects using Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method Injection.

2. Autofac: It is a lightweight Dependency Injection framework that supports Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method Injection. It provides a wide range of features such as lifetime scopes, module registration, and automatic type registration.

3. Unity: It is a popular Dependency Injection framework for .NET applications that supports Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method Injection. It provides features such as container hierarchies, named dependencies, and interception.

4. Simple Injector: It is a fast and flexible Dependency Injection framework for .NET applications that supports Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method Injection. It provides features such as registration by convention, auto-wiring, and hybrid lifestyle support.

5. Castle Windsor: It is a mature and popular Dependency Injection framework for .NET applications that supports Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method Injection. It provides features such as dynamic interception, automatic registration, and multi-platform support.
